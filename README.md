# conways-game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life implemented with a .NET API and SQLite database.

## Limitations
- The game board is finite, and bounded to 100x100 squares.
- Only initial board state is persisted to database.
- The "Get final state" endpoint has not been implemented.

## Run Locally
1. Pull repository
2. `dotnet run`
